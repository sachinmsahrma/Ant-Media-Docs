Amazon S3 Integration lets you upload your MP4 files and previews to S3
automatically so that you do not need to worry about disk space in your
server. Here is the simple manual how to enable S3 Integration to your
streaming app

Enable AWS S3 in your Streaming App
-----------------------------------

-  In order to programmatically access to S3, you should have access
   token and secret keys. You can create a programmatic user to have
   access token and secret key from `AWS IAM(Identity and Access
   Management) <https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/users>`__
   console. Just ``Add User`` by checking ``Programmatic Access`` box
   and then in the next section click
   ``Attach existing policies directly`` and add ``AmazonS3FullAccess``
   access permission to this user. Copy access token and secret key for
   this user.

-  Right now, you should have ``access token``, ``secret key``,
   ``bucket name`` in your hand. You also need to know the region of
   your bucket. If you do not have any bucket, you can create it on `S3
   Console <https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home>`__

-  Add a new bean to ``red5-web.xml`` of your app as below.
   ``red5-web.xml`` file is under ``WEB-INF`` folder of your app. For
   instance ``webapps/LiveApp/WEB-INF/red5-web.xml``

.. code:: xml

   <bean id="app.storageClient" class="io.antmedia.storage.AmazonS3StorageClient">
       <property name="accessKey" value="Enter your S3_ACCESS_KEY" />
       <property name="secretKey" value="Enter your S3_SECRET_KEY" />
       <property name="region" value="Enter your REGION_NAME e.g. eu-central-1" />
       <property name="storageName" value="Enter your BUCKET_NAME" />
   </bean>

You should set the values accordingly to your access token, secret key,
region name and bucket name. You can learn your region’s programmatic
name `from
here <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html>`__.

-  Save the file and restart the server

::

   sudo service antmedia restart

Your MP4 files and Preview files will be uploaded to your S3 bucket
automatically.

Forward MP4 and Preview Request to S3 in your Streaming App
-----------------------------------------------------------

This section is optional. If you want to forward http requests to MP4
files and Preview files to S3 directly, you can use a HTTP filter. \*
Clone the sample app from here
https://gitlab.com/Ant-Media/SampleApp.git

-  Open the ``HttpForwardFilter`` in
   ``io.antmedia.serverapp.pscp.filter`` package and uncomment the lines
   with changing your bucket url name

.. code:: java

   public class HttpForwardFilter implements javax.servlet.Filter {

       @Override
       public void destroy() {

       }

       @Override
       public void doFilter(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response,
               FilterChain chain) throws IOException, ServletException {
           String requestURI = ((HttpServletRequest)request).getRequestURI();

           
           File f = new File("webapps/"+ requestURI);
           if (!f.exists()) 
           {
               String redirectUri = "WRITE YOUR BUCKET URL like https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/" + requestURI;
               HttpServletResponse httpResponse = (HttpServletResponse) response;
               httpResponse.sendRedirect(redirectUri);
               return;
           }
           
           
           chain.doFilter(request, response);
       }

       @Override
       public void init(FilterConfig arg0) throws ServletException {

       }

   }

-  You also need to add S3 bean ``red5-web.xml`` in ``WEB-INF`` folder
-  Package the app with Maven ``mvn clean package -Dgpg.skip=true``
   After the command is done, you will have ``WAR`` file under
   ``target`` directory

-  Copy the created WAR file under ``webapps`` directory by removing old
   LiveApp directory and restart the server

::

   sudo rm -rf /usr/local/antmedia/webapps/LiveApp
   sudo cp target/LiveApp*.war /usr/local/antmedia/webapps/
   sudo service antmedia restart

After server restarted, MP4 and Preview files will be forwarded to S3
directly.

I hope this manual help you in S3 integration to your app, if you have
any problem or question with that just let us know at
