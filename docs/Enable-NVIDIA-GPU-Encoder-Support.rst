Ant Media Server can use hardware-based encoder that is available in
some NVIDIA GPUs. If you have a NVIDIA GPU, you can check that your GPU
contains hardware-based encoder on `Video Encode and Decode GPU Support
Matrix <https://developer.nvidia.com/video-encode-decode-gpu-support-matrix>`__

Why to Use NVIDIA GPU Encoder?
------------------------------

Answer is Performance. Performance increases 5x over x264(CPU) encoder.
Btw, x264 is one of the best h.264 software encoder and Ant Media Server
uses x264 if there is no GPU in the system.

Install CUDA Toolkit
--------------------

After you are sure that your GPU contains hardware-based encoder, the
only thing is installing CUDA toolkit to your system.

Installation on Ubuntu 16.04 x86_64
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Download the deb file

::

   wget https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/ubuntu1604/x86_64/cuda-repo-ubuntu1604_9.2.88-1_amd64.deb

Install repository meta-data

::

   sudo dpkg -i cuda-repo-ubuntu1604_9.2.88-1_amd64.deb

Install CUDA Public GPG Key

::

   sudo apt-key adv --fetch-keys http://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/ubuntu1604/x86_64/7fa2af80.pub

Update repository cache

::

   sudo apt-get update

Install CUDA

::

   sudo apt-get install cuda

If everthing is ok, you can run the command below to see the status of
your GPU

::

   nvidia-smi

You can install Ant Media Server with its usual way or if you already
install it, you can restart the Ant Media Server.

::

   sudo service antmedia restart

Using NVIDIA Hardware-based Encoder
-----------------------------------

Ant Media Server will check and log at startup if there is a
hardware-based GPU encoder in the system and it will use it
automatically. No need to do anything. Log at startup will be as follows
pay attention the line ``cuda verify result true`` below

::

   Running on  Linux
