There should be a ``enable_ssl.sh`` file in the installation directory.
Call the enable_ssl.sh with your domain name

   Usage:
   sudo ./enable_ssl.sh -d {DOMAIN_NAME}
   sudo ./enable_ssl.sh -f {FULL_CHAIN_FILE} -p {PRIVATE_KEY_FILE} -d {DOMAIN_NAME} 
   sudo servive apache2 start

Make sure that your domain points to your server public IP address in
the DNS records

If the above scripts returns successfully, SSL will be installed your
server, you can use https through 5443. Like below
