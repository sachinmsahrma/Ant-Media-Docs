In this article, we will explain how to reduce latency for RTMP to HLS.
But firstly we will keep you inform some of terms Stream protocols like
RTMP and HLS about the used technologies.

What is RTMP (Real Time Messaging Protocol) ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

RTMP means Real Time Messaging Protocol. RTMP is mostly depreciated for
use as a viewer-facing video streaming protocol. However, RTMP is the
most commonly used streaming protocol.

What is HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The HLS(HTTP Live Streaming) protocol was developed by Apple. The HLS
streaming protocol works by chopping MPEG-TS video content into short
chunks. On slow network speed, HLS allows the player to use a lower
quality video, thus reducing bandwidth usage. HLS videos can be made
highly available by providing multiple servers for the same video,
allowing the player to swap seamlessly if one of the servers fails.

How to Reduce latency for RTMP -> HLS Streaming ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To reduce the HLS latency there are some parameters and it can be
reduced to 8-10 secs for now.

-  One of the parameter is having HLS segment time lower value which is
   by default 2 sec in Ant Media Server and you can decrease this value
   to have lower latency but then players start to poll server more
   frequently and it can be waste of resource usage.

-  OBS Advanced Keyframe Interval: Second critical parameter is sending
   key frame in every 2 seconds(This value should consistent with HLS
   segment time) and it is critical to split videos into 2 sec duration
   segments. Open Broadcaster Software(OBS) sends key frame for every 10
   seconds by default and the latency will increase to 30 seconds |Key
   Frame Interval|

After you have done these adjustments, your delay will be significantly
reduced.

If you are still having issues, please let us know that.
