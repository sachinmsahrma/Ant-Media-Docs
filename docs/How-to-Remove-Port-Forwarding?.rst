Check that which port forwardings exist in your system with below
command.

::

   sudo iptables -t nat --line-numbers -L

The command above should give an output live below

::

   Chain PREROUTING (policy ACCEPT)
   num  target     prot opt source               destination         
   1    REDIRECT   tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere             tcp dpt:https redir ports 5443
   2    REDIRECT   tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere             tcp dpt:http redir ports 5080

   ...

Delete the rule by line number. For instance to delete the http -> 5080
forwarding, run the command below

::

   iptables -t nat -D PREROUTING 2

parameter 2 is the line number, if you want to delete https -> 5443, you
should use 1 instead of 2
