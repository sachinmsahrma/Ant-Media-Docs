-  First of all make sure that A record is entered in your DNS settings
   and point to your server.
-  If you are sure about that, check your ports whether 443 or 80 ports
   are not blocked or forwarded to any port.
-  If you forward 80 or 443 ports to 5080 and 5443, then please remove
   these port forwarding settings as described
   `here <https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/wiki/How-to-Remove-Port-Forwarding%3F>`__.

If you are still having issues, please let us know that.
