Ant Media Server can convert the RTMP URL or WebRTC Stream to the HLS
and can record in MP4.

Play Live Streams with HLS
--------------------------

Firstly, make sure that HLS muxing is enabled in your application. You
can check it on web management panel and check the ``HLS Muxing`` box in
Settings of the app.

Assume that HLS Muxing is enabled and there is a stream publishing to
Ant Media Server with an RTMP URL in this format:
``rtmp://<SERVER_NAME>/LiveApp/<STREAM_ID>``

-  In Community Edition, HLS URL is in this format:
   ``http://<SERVER_NAME>:5080/LiveApp/streams/<STREAM_ID>.m3u8``

-  In Enterprise Edition, HLS URL is in this format:
   ``http://<SERVER_NAME>:5080/LiveApp/streams/<STREAM_ID>_adaptive.m3u8``

Play VoD Streams with MP4
-------------------------

Firstly, make sure again that MP4 muxing for live streams is enabled on
your application. You can see that in the settings of the app on web
management panel.

Assume that there is a stream is publishing to the Ant Media Server with
an URL in this format ``rtmp://<SERVER_NAME>/LiveApp/<STREAM_ID>`` .

After publishing is finished, MP4 file will be created. \* In community
edition, MP4 URL will be available in this URL
``http://<SERVER_NAME>:5080/LiveApp/streams/<STREAM_ID>.mp4``

-  In Enterprise Edition, MP4 for different bitrates is also created.
   Assume that you have 480p and 240p resolution enabled in adaptive
   bitrates settings. Then you will have two more mp4 files with
   following format

   -  ``http://<SERVER_NAME>:5080/LiveApp/streams/<STREAM_ID>_480p.mp4``
   -  ``http://<SERVER_NAME>:5080/LiveApp/streams/<STREAM_ID>_240p.mp4``

Play Live and VoD streams with Embedded Player in Ant Media Server
------------------------------------------------------------------

Both Community and Enterprise Edition have embedded player. It can play
both Live and VoD streams. Again assume that there is a live stream in
Ant Media Server with ``<STREAM_ID>`` then you can watch and embed the
live the stream in following URL format

``http://<SERVER_NAME>:5080/LiveApp/play.html?name=<STREAM_ID>``

After live stream is finished, the URL above plays the recorded MP4 file
if it is created.

Get Preview Live and VoD Streams (Enterprise Only)
--------------------------------------------------

-  Preview image URL will be available in this URL template
   ``http://<SERVER_NAME>:5080/<APP_NAME>/previews/<STREAM_ID>.png``
-  Preview image is saved as 480p
-  Preview settings on
   ``<ANT_MEDIA_SERVER_DIR>/webapps/<APP_NAME>/WEB-INF/red5-web.properties``
   file

   -  ``settings.createPreviewPeriod=<PERIOD_MS>`` : Preview image
      creation period in milliseconds
   -  ``settings.addDateTimeToMp4FileName`` : true or false. If true,
      adds date time value to preview file names. If false, it does not
      add date time values to preview file names
   -  ``settings.previewOverwrite`` : true or false. If false, when a
      new stream is received with the same stream id, ``_N`` (increasing
      number) suffix is added to preview file name. If true, new preview
      file is replaced with the old file with .png when a new stream
      with the same stream id is received.
