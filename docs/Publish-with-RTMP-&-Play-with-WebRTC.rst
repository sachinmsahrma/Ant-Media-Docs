Developers can make their app users broadcast live video not only from
their browser with WebRTC, but also from OBS, thanks to WebRTC Adapter.
Let’s start with introducing OBS which stands for Open Broadcaster
Software. OBS is a free open source software for video recording and
live streaming. You can use either your PC’s embedded camera or
externally connected one as a video source with OBS. Sound sources also
can be configured with it. Ant Media Server Enterprise is fully
compatible with OBS.

Let’s have a look at step by step how to use OBS for streaming: ### Step
1: Getting the OBS:

Download via its official `web page <https://obsproject.com/>`__. It has
Windows, Mac, and Linux releases.

Step 2 : Provide Sources:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

RTMP stream from OBS for WebRTC replay

By default, OBS starts to capture from your embedded camera if exists
after initialized. You can add or remove video/audio source from Sources
section, such as an image can be broadcasted as a video source or
external microphone can be added as an audio source.

Step 3: Configure the Ant Media Server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Contact with us from `contact form <https://antmedia.io/#contacts>`__ in
order to try Ant Media Server Enterprise Edition. Extract the Ant Media
Server Enterprise zip file and start the server with start.sh command in
the terminal. For detailed information please follow steps described in
the `Getting
Started <https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/wiki/Getting-Started>`__.

::

   cd /path/to/ant-media-server

   ./start.sh

After that, you need to create a live stream on Ant Media Server
Enterprise Management console. You can reach it at
``http://<server-address>:5080`` address, then click ``WebRTCAppEE``
from Applications section and ``New Live Stream``. The server creates a
live stream with an unique ID with the format of
``rtmp://<server-address>/WebRTCAppEE/325859929809451108600212``. You
can copy this url with clicking clipboard icon.

Step 4: Configure the OBS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You need to write live stream parameters to OBS in order to start
broadcasting. Click ``Settings`` then select ``Stream`` tab. Split the
``rtmp://<server-address>/WebRTCAppEE/325859929809451108600212`` url and
and write url and stream key parameters as described in the below image.
Make sure that Stream ID should be written to Stream Key field, not to
the url.

Server|

**If you want to decrease latency as well, you can ``tune`` encoder for
``zerolatency`` in encoder settings.**

Step 5 : Start Stream and Watch 🙂
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Close settings window and just click the ``Start Streaming`` button in
the main window of OBS. You can watch WebRTC stream from either Ant
Media Management console or other platforms such as VLC player with same
RTMP URL.

To Play with WebRTC, go to
``http://<server-address>:5080/WebRTCAppEE/player.html`` and enter the
stream key parameter and click “Start Playing” button.

You can also play on Ant Media Management console which plays via HLS at
about 8-10 seconds latency. A dialog will be displayed where you can
watch the live stream.
