Test Environment
================

Test environment has two parts: test server and SUT (system under test).
We have two different setups for two different SUT.

One Instance Setup
------------------

Here we have only one Ant Media Server instance as SUT.

Preparation of Setup:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  To prepare Ant Media Server, please look at
   `here <https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/wiki/Getting-Started>`__.
-  To prepare Test Server, please look at
   `here <https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/wiki/Preparation-of-Test-Server-and-Running-Tests>`__.

Cluster Setup
-------------

Here we have a cluster structure as SUT which contains one origin and N
edge servers.
