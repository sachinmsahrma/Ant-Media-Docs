Test Plans
==========

We have 5 different load test plans for different aims.

HLS Player Load Test 
--------------------

*aim:* This test is performed to determine the maximum number of HLS players that play the same stream.
  
*scenario:* We publish a stream with RTMP and connect increasing numbers of HLS players to the stream. 
  
*measurements:* By using REST api we get CPU and memory usage. We get speed from ffmpeg.  
  
*expectations:* speed >= 1x results

*results:* As a result, we have 3 plots: 
  - CPU usage vs time 
  - Publisher/Players count vs time
  - Memory usage vs time
  
RTMP Player Load Test 
---------------------
*aim:* This test is performed to determine the maximum number of RTMP players that play the same stream. 

*scenario:* We publish a stream with RTMP and connect increasing numbers of RTMP players to the stream. 

*measurements:* By using REST api we get CPU and memory usage. We get speed from ffmpeg.  

*expectations:* speed >= 1x results

*results:* As a result, we have 3 plots: 
  - CPU usage vs time 
  - Publisher/Players count vs time
  - Memory usage vs time 

WebRTC Player Load Test 
-----------------------
*aim:* This test is performed to determine the maximum number of WebRTC players that play the same stream. 

*scenario:* We publish a stream with WebRTC and connect increasing numbers of WebRTC players to the stream.

*measurements:* By using REST api we get CPU usage, memory usage.

*results:* As a result, we have 6 plots:
  - CPU usage vs time 
  - Publisher/Players count vs time
  - Memory usage vs time
  - Measured & Send bitrate vs time 
  - Video Send Period vs time
  - Audio Send Period vs time

RTMP Publisher Load Test 
------------------------
*aim:* This test is performed to determine the maximum number of RTMP publishers for a server. 

*scenario:* We create the increasing number of publishers that publish to the same server. This test can be made for different encoding settings. 

*measurements:* By using REST api we get CPU usage, memory usage. 

*expectations:* If there is no encoding CPU usage is to be very low compared to the existence of encoding.

*results:* As a result, we have 3 plots: 
  - CPU usage vs time 
  - Publisher/Players count vs time
  - Memory usage vs time 

WebRTC Publisher Load Test
--------------------------
*aim:* This test is performed to determine the maximum number of WebRTC publishers for a server. 

*scenario:* We create the increasing number of publishers that publish to the same server. This test can be made for different encoding settings. 

*measurements:* By using REST api we get CPU usage, memory usage. 

*expectations:* If there is no  encoding CPU usage is to be very low compared to the existence of encoding. 

*results:* As a result, we have 3 plots: 
  - CPU usage vs time 
  - Publisher/Players count vs time
  - Memory usage vs time
