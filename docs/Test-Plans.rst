Test Plans
==========

We have 5 different load test plans(prepared with JMeter) for different aims.

HLS Player Load Test 
--------------------

*aim:* This test is performed to determine the maximum number of HLS players that play the same stream.
  
*scenario:* We publish a stream with RTMP and connect increasing numbers of HLS players to the stream. 
  
*measurements:* By using REST api we get CPU and memory usage. With JMeter, we measure the time to get one ts file. 
  
*expectations:* one ts download time is to be the duration of ts. (for Test_600kbps.mp4 ts durations are 2 sec)

*results:* As a result, we have 3 plots: 
  - CPU usage vs Players count
  - Memory usage vs Players count 
  - Time to get one ts vs Players count
  
RTMP Player Load Test 
---------------------
*aim:* This test is performed to determine the maximum number of RTMP players that play the same stream. 

*scenario:* We publish a stream with RTMP and connect increasing numbers of RTMP players to the stream. 

*measurements:* By using REST api we get CPU and memory usage. With RTMPClient tool, we measure latency which is the time difference between the total time to collect 25 frames and DTS/display time) of the 25th frame. 

*expectations:* latency is to be zero. 

*results:* As a result, we have 3 plots: 
- CPU usage vs Players count 
- Memory usage vs Players count 
- Latency vs Players count

WebRTC Player Load Test 
-----------------------
*aim:* This test is performed to determine the maximum number of WebRTC players that play the same stream. 

*scenario:* We publish a stream with WebRTC and connect increasing numbers of WebRTC players to the stream.

*measurements:* By using REST api we get CPU usage, memory usage.

*results:* As a result, we have 4 plots:
- CPU usage vs Players count
- Memory usage vs Players count 

RTMP Publisher Load Test 
------------------------
*aim:* This test is performed to determine the maximum number of RTMP publishers for a server. 

*scenario:* We create the increasing number of publishers that publish to the same server. This test can be made for different encoding settings. 

*measurements:* By using REST api we get CPU usage, memory usage. 

*expectations:* If there is no encoding CPU usage is to be very low compared to the existence of encoding.

*results:* As a result, we have 2 plots: 
- CPU usage vs Publisher count 
- Memory usage vs Publisher count

WebRTC Publisher Load Test
--------------------------
*aim:* This test is performed to determine the maximum number of WebRTC publishers for a server. 

*scenario:* We create the increasing number of publishers that publish to the same server. This test can be made for different encoding settings. 

*measurements:* By using REST api we get CPU usage, memory usage. 

*expectations:* If there is no  encoding CPU usage is to be very low compared to the existence of encoding. 

*results:* As a result, we have 3 plots: 
- CPU usage vs Publisher count 
- Memory usage vs Publisher count
