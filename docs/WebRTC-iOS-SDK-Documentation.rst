This library simplifies connection between browsers and iOS Devices
(iPhone and iPad for now) by using Ant Media server as a signaling
server.

This documentation aims to introduce how to use AntMedia WebRTC iOS SDK
in your application. This SDK supports three modes: Peer to peer, play
and publish.

Features
~~~~~~~~

-  Fully written in Swift 4.
-  Peer Connection: Two nodes connect to each other, 1-1 connection
-  Publish: One node publishes, 1-N connection
-  Play: Other nodes play broadcast from publisher,1-N connection
-  Allows to enable/disable camera and micrphone for local stream
-  Simple and concise codebase. You just need a few initialization and
   delegation.
-  Clear error messages

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to use this SDK, you need iOS 10+, WebRTC build, AntMedia
WebRTC iOS SDK, Starscream library for signaling and Ant Media Server
Enterprise Edition. Please contact us at contact@antmedia.io. We can
provide WebRTC Android SDK and Enterprise Edition for trying or personal
use.

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  We already built a version of WebRTC for iOS platform. Here is the
   link to download: https://antmedia.io/. After download, in Xcode,
   select your application as target and add WebRTC.framework as
   embedded binaries.

-  Next step is about signaling: This SDK uses Starscream to manage
   WebSocket connections. So if you use Pod or Carthage, please follow
   the steps: `GitHub -
   daltoniam/Starscream <https://github.com/daltoniam/starscream#installation>`__

-  Now add AntMedia WebRTC iOS SDK to your project as embedded binaries.

Eventually, you should have two embedded binaries and Starscream via
dependency management tool. Now you are ready to use SDK in your
application.

Usage First, in ViewController, import AntMediaSDK and WebRTC libraries.

::

   import AntMediaSDK
   import WebRTC

Than we are ready to use AntMediaClient with just one line:

::

   let client = AntMediaClient.init()

Before to start connection, we just need to set a few options: Local and
remote video views as ``RTCEAGLVideoView`` which is provided by WebRTC
and ``AntMediaClientDelegate`` to handle notifications that delivered by
SDK. Let’s define these in ViewController:

::

   class YourViewController: UIViewController {
       @IBOutlet weak var localVideoView: RTCEAGLVideoView!
       @IBOutlet weak var remoteVideoView: RTCEAGLVideoView!
   }

And here is AntMediaClientDelegate:

::

   extension YourViewController: AntMediaClientDelegate {  
       // Add all protocol methods.
   }

So we are ready to initialize and start AntMediaClient with using server
url, stream id and mode:

::

   client.delegate = self
   client.setOptions(url: server, streamId: room, mode: self.getMode())
   client.setVideoViews(local: localVideoView, remote: remoteVideoView)

If you run the Ant Media Server (Enterprise Edition) on your computer,
server url should be localhost, if not ip address should be used. Please
do not forget to the protocol (ws or wss).

Stream id is a kind of room name to make it easier finding each node.

There are three modes: P2P, Play and Publish. You can use
``AntMediaClientMode`` to use each one.

If you complete these steps, AntMediaClient instance is ready for
connection:

``client.connect()``

After you call connect method, clientDidConnect or clientDidDisconnect
methods will be called. If connection is okay, client is ready to start
for streaming. You just need to call start method:

``client.start()``

Before to go, please do not forget to add Camera and Microphone usage
description in Info.plist. Otherwise it will crash.

Delegation
^^^^^^^^^^

There are 6 methods on AntMediaClientDelegate:

-  clientDidConnect: This method will be called if connection is okay
   with Ant Media Server.
-  clientDidDisconnect: This method will be called if connection fails.
   Message is available as an argument to handle what’s wrong: Network
   issues or server issues etc.
-  clientHasError: This method will be called if something goes wrong:
   Socket issues, if remote close the connection etc.
-  remoteStreamStarted: This method will be called after the remote
   source is available. This method is generally used for setting ratio
   and content mode.
-  remoteStreamRemoved: This method will be called if the remote source
   closes connection or leaves from room. This method is generally used
   for setting ratio and content mode.
-  localStreamStarted: This method will be called when camera capturing
   and microphone is ready to use.

Support

This SDK is still on the beta version. We appreciate if you share any
experience with us. Please do not hesitate to open issue.
